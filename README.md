node-ext2fs
=========
### WASM bindings to the linux ext{2,3,4} filesystem library

node-ext2fs uses the [e2fsprogs](https://github.com/tytso/e2fsprogs) project to
provide access to ext filesystem from javascript.

The `node-` in `node-ext2fs` is here because it was a native node module until `v3.0.0` (excluded).
Since `v3.0.0`, it is a WebAssembly module built with [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

Some things you can do with this module:

* Read/write files in a filesystem image directly without mounting
* Use familiar APIs, node-ext2fs has the exact same interface as node's `fs` module
* Combine node-ext2fs filesystem streams with host filesystem streams (e.g copy files)
* Create a tar archive from a filesystem image
* Perform a TRIM operation to obtain discard regions of a filesystem

Installation
------------

Simply install `node-ext2fs` using `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install node-ext2fs
```

Building
--------

To build `node-ext2fs` you need to have `make` and `emcc` from emscripten >= 2.0.7 available on your
environment.

Build `node-ext2fs` using `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm run build
```

Usage
-----

Mount a disk image and use the returned `fs` object.
The fs returned object behaves like node's `fs` except it doesn't provide any
xxxxSync method.
You can also issue `DISCARD` requests using the fs `async trim()` method.

See the example below.

Example
-------

```javascript
const { withMountedDisk } = require('ext2fs');
const { FileDisk, withOpenFile } = require('file-disk');
const { promisify } = require('util');

async function main() {
	const diskImage = '/some/disk.image';
	const offset = 272629760;  // offset of the ext partition you want to mount in that disk image
        try {
                await withOpenFile(diskImage, 'r', async (handle) => {
                        const disk = new FileDisk(handle);
                        await withMountedDisk(disk, offset, async (fs) => {
                                const readdir = promisify(fs.readdir);
				// List files
                                console.log('readdir', await readdir('/'));
                                await fs.trim();
				// Show discarded regions
                                console.log('discarded', disk.getDiscardedChunks());
				// Show ranges of useful data aligned to 1MiB
                                console.log('ranges', await disk.getRanges(1024 ** 2));
                        });
                });
        } catch (error) {
                console.error(error);
        }
}

```
